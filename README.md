This was a competitive 24-hour coding competition, where the goal was to deliver a scalable solution to a Non-Profit Organisation. In this program, students from different universities across India teamed up to develop an innovative technological solution for a non-profit organisation's needs. The non-profit assigned to our team was Janaagraha.
