This was a competitive 24-hour coding competition, where the goal was to deliver a scalable solution to a Non-Profit Organisation. In this program, students from different universities across India teamed up to develop an innovative technological solution for a non-profit organisation's needs. The non-profit assigned to our team was Janaagraha.

Janaagraha’s mission is to transform quality of life in India’s cities and towns.  They work with citizens to catalyse active citizenship in city neighbourhoods and with governments to institute reforms to city governance.  Civic Learning, Civic Participation and Advocacy and Reforms are Janaagraha’s three major strands of work to accomplish its mission.
